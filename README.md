Welcome to the Daily Activity Pattern Analysis Notebook! 

In [this notebook](https://ntaxus.github.io/ActivityPatterns/), we will explore the fascinating world of animal behavior by
analyzing the daily activity patterns of multiple species and examining
the level of overlap among them. Understanding these patterns provides
valuable insights into ecological roles, resource utilization, and
species interactions within ecosystems. Through statistical analyses and
data visualization, we aim to identify peak activity times, assess
temporal overlap, and help to understand the factors influencing
variations in activity patterns.
